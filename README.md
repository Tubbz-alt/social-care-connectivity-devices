# Social Care Connectivity & Devices
An [NHSX led programme](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/social-care/ipad-offer-care-homes/) to procure and gift 11,000 (data-enabled) iPads to care homes in response to COVID-19 ([Terms of use](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/social-care/terms-use-and-eligibility-criteria-ipads-care-homes/)). This is so that staff can access remote health consultations for the people in their care.

We are continuing to help care homes access digital tools and services. If you would like to be informed about any future offers from NHSX, [please register your details](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/2UGJAW/) and share your comments.

## How we prioritise the eligibility criteria

[Prioritisation of the devices](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/social-care/eligibility-criteria-ipad-offer/) will be to care homes in England that receive all or some of their funding for residential care from the NHS or from a local authority and apply for a device using our order form (now closed).

### Priority 1

- Care homes with under 40 beds (and no tablet devices) will qualify for 1 device. 
- Care homes with more than 40 beds (and no tablet devices) will qualify for 2 devices. 
- Care homes with more than 40 beds (and 1 tablet device) will quality for 1 device.

If a care home has more devices, but answered the following question: "Which of the following issues may make it difficult to facilitate video calls with GPs and health and care professionals?" with either:
- **A:** "Our tablet devices are not good enough (i.e. theyâ€™re too old/slow/do not have the right features)"

*OR*
- **B:** "Our tablet are reserved for-or locked down to- other things and cannot be used for remote consultations"

*OR*
- **C:** "Our tablet are not capable of assiting you with remote consultations with health care professionals"

Then
- Care homes with under 40 beds will qualify for 1 device. 
- Care homes with more than 40 beds will qualify for 2 devices. 

### Priority 2

If there are devices remaining after priority 1, care homes who have less than 2 devices and responded to the following question: "Which of the following issues may make it difficult to facilitate video calls with GPs and health and care professionals?"
- **A:** "Not enough tablet devices for staff to use for this purpose"

Will receive 1 device

## Logic Model

A logic model was developed to apply the eligibility criteria outlined above. Please note that local intelligence from CQC, Local Authority, and NHS colleagues were used in the final decision making criteria. There are only six logic gates in the model. Each gate is based on answers to survey responses we received. Depending on the responses, each care home can move down only one route to a particular Priority and Allocation of Devices.

|Route|Gate 1|Gate 2|Gate 3|Gate 4|Gate 5|Gate 6|Priority|Number of iPads|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-:|
|1|More than 40 Residents|No current devices| | | |	|Priority One|2|
|2|More than 40 Residents| |Devices not adequate| | | |Priority One	|2|
|3|Less than 40 Residents|No current devices| | | |	|Priority One	|1|
|4|Less than 40 Residents|	|Devices not adequate | | |	|Priority One|1|
|5|More than 40 Residents| |Devices adequate|	|Only one Current Device| |Priority One|1|
|6|Less than 40 Residents| |Devices adequate|	|Has less than two devices|Not enough devices|Priority Two|1|
|7|More than 40 Residents| |Devices adequate|	Two or more current devices|Has less than three devices	|Not enough devices	|Priority Two|1|
|8|Less than 40 Residents| |Devices adequate| |Has more than two devices| |Ineligible|0|
