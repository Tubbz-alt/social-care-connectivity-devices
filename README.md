# Social Care Connectivity Database
NHSX led programme to procure and gift 11,000 (data-enabled where needed) iPads to care homes in response to COVID-19. This is so that staff can access remote health consultations for the people in their care. We plan to distribute the iPads by autumn 2020 ahead of a second wave of COVID-19 and winter pressures.
